## Config files

### `eslintrc.json`

Has all the rules/config for ESLint.

### `mocharc.jsonc`

Config settings for mocha when running it from the command line.

- `ts-node/register` - for compilation.

- `module-alias/register` - for path alias recognition.

### `package.json`

#### `scripts`

- `clean` - removes `dist` folder.

- `build` - runs `clean` and builds app.

- `start` - cleans, builds, and starts app.

- `test` - runs `mocha` with settings in `mocharc.jsonc`.

#### `_moduleAliases`

Needed for `module-alias` package. Should match keys in `paths` of `tsconfig.json` as such (note the lack of wildcard in `package.json`):

`package.json`

```json
{
  // ...
  "_moduleAliases": {
    "@service": "dist/service"
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

`tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "paths": {
      "@service/*": ["./src/service"]
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### `tsconfig.json`

`include` key is for including any source files that you want VSCode to recognize.

#### `tsconfig-build.json`

Used only for build to exclude the `test` folder in compilation.

## Visual Studio Code

After cloning and prior to opening in Visual Studio Code, go ahead and run the install and build commands to prevent it barking at you.

`npm install`

`npm run build`

Once you have the folder open in Visual Studio Code, it will prompt you to download some recommended extensions... Do that...
